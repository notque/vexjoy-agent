## Overview

Data pipeline testing has a different failure mode than application testing: tests that pass but don't catch real data quality issues are common because test authors don't know what "bad data" looks like for their domain. Good pipeline tests are specific: they assert grain, referential integrity, freshness windows, and business-rule violations — not just "column is not null."

---

## Pattern Table: Test Layers

| Layer | Tool | What It Catches | When to Run |
|-------|------|-----------------|-------------|
| Schema tests | dbt schema YAML | Null PKs, duplicate IDs, referential integrity | After every transform |
| Data tests | dbt `data` tests | Business rule violations, cross-table consistency | After every transform |
| Freshness assertions | dbt source freshness | Stale data from upstream | Before pipeline start |
| Statistical tests | Great Expectations | Distribution drift, unexpected nulls, range violations | After staging load |
| Row count reconciliation | SQL assertion | Extract count matches load count | After every load step |

---

## Correct Patterns

### dbt Schema Tests — Minimum Viable Set

```yaml
# models/schema.yml
version: 2

models:
  - name: fact_orders
    description: "One row per order line item per day"
    columns:
      - name: order_line_id
        description: "Surrogate key — unique identifier for this fact row"
        tests:
          - unique              # No duplicate fact rows
          - not_null            # Every row has an identifier

      - name: customer_id
        tests:
          - not_null            # Orphaned facts are silent errors
          - relationships:      # Referential integrity
              to: ref('dim_customer')
              field: customer_id

      - name: order_date
        tests:
          - not_null
          - dbt_utils.accepted_range:  # dbt-utils package
              min_value: "'2020-01-01'"
              max_value: "current_date + interval '1 day'"

      - name: status
        tests:
          - accepted_values:
              values: ['pending', 'confirmed', 'shipped', 'delivered', 'cancelled']
```

**Why**: The minimum set is `unique` + `not_null` on PKs, and `relationships` on FKs. Missing referential integrity tests allow orphaned facts that produce wrong aggregates without any error.

### dbt Singular Tests for Business Rules

```sql
-- tests/assert_no_negative_revenue.sql
-- Fails if any row has negative revenue (data quality issue in source)
SELECT
  order_id,
  total_amount
FROM {{ ref('fact_orders') }}
WHERE total_amount < 0
  AND status != 'refund'  -- Refunds are legitimately negative
```

```sql
-- tests/assert_orders_grain.sql
-- Fails if fact table grain is violated (duplicate order_line_id per day)
SELECT
  order_line_id,
  order_date,
  COUNT(*) AS row_count
FROM {{ ref('fact_orders') }}
GROUP BY order_line_id, order_date
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
```

**Why**: Generic schema tests (`unique`, `not_null`) can't enforce business-domain rules. Singular tests let you write any SQL that returns rows to fail the test — domain logic as code.

---

### dbt Source Freshness Configuration

```yaml
# models/sources.yml
version: 2

sources:
  - name: raw
    database: prod
    schema: raw_ingestion
    freshness:
      warn_after: {count: 6, period: hour}    # Warning: stale > 6h
      error_after: {count: 24, period: hour}   # Error: stale > 24h
    loaded_at_field: _extracted_at

    tables:
      - name: orders
        freshness:
          warn_after: {count: 1, period: hour}   # Orders data: tighter SLA
          error_after: {count: 4, period: hour}

      - name: events
        freshness:
          warn_after: {count: 30, period: minute}
          error_after: {count: 2, period: hour}
```

```bash
# Run freshness check before pipeline execution
dbt source freshness --select source:raw
# If this fails, don't run downstream transforms — they'd work on stale data
```

**Why**: Running transforms on stale data produces silent errors — pipelines appear to succeed but produce yesterday's numbers. Freshness checks prevent this by failing loudly before transforms run.

### Row Count Reconciliation in Airflow

```python
# dags/pipeline_with_reconciliation.py
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from airflow.providers.postgres.hooks.postgres import PostgresHook

def reconcile_row_counts(source_table, target_table, ds, **kwargs):
    """Verify row count in source matches target after load."""
    hook = PostgresHook(postgres_conn_id='warehouse')

    source_count = hook.get_first(
        f"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM {source_table} WHERE DATE(created_at) = %s",
        parameters=(ds,)
    )[0]

    target_count = hook.get_first(
        f"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM {target_table} WHERE order_date = %s",
        parameters=(ds,)
    )[0]

    if source_count != target_count:
        raise ValueError(
            f"Row count mismatch: {source_table}={source_count}, "
            f"{target_table}={target_count} for {ds}"
        )

reconcile_task = PythonOperator(
    task_id='reconcile_counts',
    python_callable=reconcile_row_counts,
    op_kwargs={'source_table': 'raw.orders', 'target_table': 'dw.fact_orders'},
)
```

**Why**: Row count mismatch is the simplest possible data quality check and catches most load failures — truncated loads, missed partitions, duplicate loads. Implement this before more complex statistical tests.

## Anti-Pattern Catalog

### ❌ dbt Models Without Any Tests

**Detection**:
```bash
# Models with no tests at all
dbt ls --resource-type model --output name | sort > /tmp/all_models.txt
dbt ls --resource-type test --output name \
  | sed 's/^[^.]*\.\([^.]*\)\..*/\1/' \
  | sort -u > /tmp/tested_models.txt
comm -23 /tmp/all_models.txt /tmp/tested_models.txt

# Quick check: ratio of tests to models
echo "Models: $(dbt ls --resource-type model | wc -l)"
echo "Tests: $(dbt ls --resource-type test | wc -l)"
```

**What it looks like**: Models in `models/` directory with no corresponding entries in `schema.yml`, or schema.yml entries with empty `tests:` lists.

**Why wrong**: Untransformed SQL that silently produces wrong data. Without `unique` + `not_null` tests on PKs, duplicate or null keys can corrupt downstream joins, producing 2x or 0.5x metrics with no error.

**Fix**: Add minimum test set for every model. The absolute minimum is `unique` + `not_null` on the primary key column.

---

### ❌ Testing Only the Staging Layer, Not Marts

**Detection**:
```bash
# Count tests by model path
dbt ls --resource-type test --output json \
  | python3 -c "
import json, sys, collections
tests = [json.loads(l) for l in sys.stdin if l.strip()]
paths = [t.get('path', '') for t in tests]
for path_prefix in ['staging', 'intermediate', 'marts']:
    count = sum(1 for p in paths if path_prefix in p)
    print(f'{path_prefix}: {count} tests')
"
```

**What it looks like**: Many tests on `models/staging/` but zero tests on `models/marts/` or `models/reporting/`.

**Why wrong**: Staging tests catch source quality issues. But mart models introduce aggregation logic, joins, and business rules that can produce wrong numbers even when source data is clean. Mart tests catch transform logic errors.

**Fix**: Add singular tests to every mart model that assert business rules — grain, no negative revenue, referential integrity across dimensions.

---

### ❌ Using `test: not_null` on Non-Key Columns Without Context

**Detection**:
```bash
# Find not_null tests on potentially nullable columns
grep -rn "not_null" models/ --include="*.yml" -B2 \
  | grep -E "name: (description|notes|middle_name|phone|optional)"
```

**What it looks like**:
```yaml
- name: customer_notes
  tests:
    - not_null  # Customers often don't have notes
```

**Why wrong**: `not_null` on optional columns causes valid data to fail tests. When tests always fail, engineers start skipping them or marking them as warnings, which erodes confidence in the entire test suite.

**Fix**: Only add `not_null` to columns that are logically required (PKs, FKs, required business fields). Use `dbt_utils.not_null_proportion` for columns that are usually-but-not-always populated:

```yaml
- name: customer_notes
  tests:
    - dbt_utils.not_null_proportion:
        at_least: 0.0  # No constraint — just document it's nullable
```

## Error-Fix Mappings

| Error Message | Root Cause | Fix |
|---------------|------------|-----|
| `Compilation Error: column "x" does not exist` | dbt schema test references column not in model | Check column name spelling; run `dbt compile` to catch before `test` |
| `Test unique_fact_orders failed: 42 rows returned` | Duplicate fact rows in grain | Investigate source duplication; add dedup step before load |
| `Source raw.orders is past the error freshness threshold` | Upstream extraction pipeline stalled | Check extraction DAG; do not run downstream transforms on stale data |
| `Great Expectations: expect_column_values_to_be_between failed` | Out-of-range values in column (negative amounts, future dates) | Validate source data; add filter or alert in extraction step |
| `dbt test: Row count reconciliation failed` | Load truncated or missed partitions | Check load task logs; verify partition coverage before marking success |

---

## Detection Commands Reference

```bash
