AI agents skip steps.

"Looks correct" replaces running tests. "Trivial change" replaces verification. The agent confidently ships broken code because nothing structurally prevented it from skipping the work.

Harnesses have a second problem: given only a skill list, they do not route eagerly enough, or correctly enough. Good skills sit unused. So this toolkit connects the skills, agents, and workflows we want directly into the harness, automatically. You don't have to understand what is here. Say what you want in plain English and you get all the value we have put into it: the right specialist with the right methodology, behind gates that demand exit codes, not assertions.

<!-- Counts here must match the Four Layers table (~line 143). Verify both: python3 scripts/validate-doc-counts.py -->
44 domain agents, 134 workflow skills, 86 hooks, 128 scripts. Agents carry knowledge, skills enforce methodology, hooks block incomplete work, scripts handle determinism.

Works across Claude Code (`/do`), Codex (`$do`), Factory (`/do`), Reasonix (`/do`).

## What It Looks Like

```
$ claude

> /do debug this Go test

  Routing: go-engineer + systematic-debugging
  Phase 1/4: Reproduce: running test, capturing failure...
  Phase 2/4: Hypothesize: 3 candidates from stack trace...
  Phase 3/4: Verify: isolated root cause in connection pool timeout
  Phase 4/4: Fix: patch applied, test passing, PR opened

  ✓ Delivered: PR #847, fix connection pool timeout in health check
```

The router reads intent, picks a Go agent paired with a debugging skill, and runs the full lifecycle. You typed one sentence. The system did the rest.

## The Pipeline

```
  ROUTE        PLAN         EXECUTE      VERIFY       DELIVER      LEARN
 ┌──────┐    ┌──────┐    ┌──────┐    ┌──────┐    ┌──────┐    ┌──────┐
 │ /do  │───▶│ Task │───▶│Agent │───▶│Tests │───▶│  PR  │───▶│Record│
 │Router│    │ Plan │    │+Skill│    │Gates │    │Branch│    │Evolve│
 └──────┘    └──────┘    └──────┘    └──────┘    └──────┘    └──────┘
```

## Anti-Rationalization

This is the single thing that separates it from "agent with a system prompt."

| Agent Says | What Happens |
|---|---|
| "Code looks correct, skip tests" | Exit gate requires test output. Blocked. |
| "Trivial change, no verification" | Hook blocks completion without evidence. |
| "Similar to before" | Skill demands case-specific proof. |
| "User is in a hurry" | Protocol overrides time pressure. |
| "I'm confident" | Gate demands exit code, not assertion. |

Hooks fire automatically. Gates block completion. Skills encode counter-arguments at every skip-worthy step. The agent verifies or it doesn't finish.

For what I do, the difference is enormous. If you're doing simple single-file edits, maybe less so.

## Knowledge Work Is First-Class

The same routing serves knowledge work. The content engine researches, drafts in a calibrated voice, validates against 397 AI patterns, and repurposes finished pieces for each platform. `/html` turns any request into a single self-contained HTML file: report, slide deck, prototype, data viz, diagram. Non-engineers who try the toolkit consistently name the HTML artifacts as the thing they love. No code, no setup beyond the installer.

## It Proves Its Own Changes

Changes to the toolkit itself ship with evidence. New skills get blind A/B tests against a no-skill baseline before merge. Routing and writing-standard decisions carry measured verdicts; [PHILOSOPHY.md](docs/PHILOSOPHY.md) cites the numbers. Experiments that lost go into the negative-results registry, [what-didnt-work.md](docs/what-didnt-work.md), so no future session re-runs a known-dead path.

The automated nightly evolution loop (`/evolve`, writes to `evolution-reports/`) ran regularly through mid-May 2026. It is currently dormant; recent evidence has come from manual PRs instead.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/notque/vexjoy-agent.git ~/vexjoy-agent
cd ~/vexjoy-agent
./install.sh
```

Links into `~/.claude/` and mirrors into `~/.codex/`, `~/.factory/`, `~/.reasonix/` — each mirror only when that runtime is detected (its command on PATH or its home dir already exists). The installer asks symlink (live updates via `git pull`) or copy (stable snapshot).

Want only part of the toolkit? Run `./install.sh --configure` to pick which skills, agents, and hooks install, or copy `.local.example/profile.yaml` to `.local/profile.yaml` and edit. No profile file = full install, unchanged behavior. Credit: [@thomasvan](https://github.com/thomasvan). Details: [.local.example/README.md](.local.example/README.md).

| CLI | Entry Point |
|-----|-------------|
| Claude Code | `/do` |
| Codex | `$do` |
| Factory | `/do` |
| Reasonix | `/do` |

**Full setup:** [docs/start-here.md](docs/start-here.md)

<details>
<summary><b>Codex CLI Parity</b></summary>

Mirrors agents, skills, and 6 allowlisted hooks into `~/.codex/`. Requires Codex CLI v0.114.0+.

**Blocked upstream:** Edit/Write interceptors waiting on [openai/codex#16732](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/16732). PreCompact, SubagentStop, Notification, SessionEnd events stay Claude Code only.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Gemini CLI / Antigravity CLI Support (removed)</b></summary>

Gemini CLI support removed (deprecated upstream, transitioned to Antigravity CLI); Antigravity support pending CLI maturity. Per Google's [transition announcement](https://developers.googleblog.com/an-important-update-transitioning-gemini-cli-to-antigravity-cli/), Gemini CLI stops serving requests on **2026-06-18** for Google AI Pro / Ultra and free Gemini Code Assist for individuals. Gemini **API** integrations (image-gen backends, sprite pipeline, `GEMINI_API_KEY`) are unaffected and stay in the toolkit.

If a prior install mirrored into `~/.gemini/`, remove the stale mirrors with:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.gemini/skills ~/.gemini/agents ~/.gemini/hooks ~/.gemini/scripts ~/.gemini/antigravity/plugins/vexjoy-agent
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Factory CLI Support</b></summary>

Mirrors agents (as "droids"), skills, and all hooks into `~/.factory/`. Hook config merges into `~/.factory/settings.json` with paths rewritten.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Reasonix Support</b></summary>

Mirrors skills, scripts, and the allowlisted hooks (`scripts/reasonix-hooks-allowlist.txt`) into `~/.reasonix/` (no agent or custom-command surface, so neither is installed; the `/do` router rides in as a skill). Reasonix fires only 4 events (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, UserPromptSubmit, Stop), so only hooks for those events are allowlisted. Hook config is written to the `hooks` key of `~/.reasonix/settings.json` in Reasonix's native flat shape (one entry per hook, `match` regex over the tool name); the generator builds absolute `python3` commands, so no path rewrite is applied. MCP/model/permissions in `~/.reasonix/config.json` are user-owned and left untouched.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Token-saving mode</b></summary>

The toolkit supplies its own routing, domain knowledge, methodology, and enforcement. The default system prompt duplicates most of that.

```bash
claude --system-prompt "."
```

Strips built-in tool-use instructions. The toolkit's agents, skills, hooks, and CLAUDE.md provide equivalent coverage.

## Four Layers

<!-- Counts here must match the intro line (~line 13). Verify both: python3 scripts/validate-doc-counts.py -->

| Layer | Count | Does |
|---|---|---|
| Agents | 44 | Domain knowledge: idiom tables, failure mode catalogs, error-to-fix mappings |
| Skills | 134 | Phased methodology with gates. Can't skip steps. Each phase has exit criteria requiring evidence. |
| Hooks | 83 | Fire on lifecycle events. Block incomplete work. Zero LLM cost. |
| Scripts | 127 | Determinism: test runners, linters, validators. No LLM judgment. |

## Philosophy

- **Zero-expertise operation.** Say what you want. The system classifies, dispatches, enforces, delivers.
- **LLMs orchestrate, programs execute.** Deterministic work belongs to scripts. LLM judgment handles design decisions, diagnosis, review.
- **Density.** Every word carries instruction, rule, or decision. Cut everything else.
- **Breadth over depth.** Right context ensures correctness. Unfocused context adds cost.
- **Structural enforcement.** Exit codes enforce what instructions can't. Quality gates are automated, not advisory.
- **Everything pipelines.** Complex work decomposes into phases. Phases have gates. Gates prevent cascading failures.

Full design philosophy: **[PHILOSOPHY.md](docs/PHILOSOPHY.md)**

## Maintenance

Two report-only scripts surface upkeep work; both print a digest and never edit, delete, or block.

- `python3 scripts/harvest-corrections.py` clusters captured user corrections by routed domain and suggests one-line doc fixes. Run weekly by habit, or schedule it via `/schedule`.
- `python3 scripts/stale-skill-scan.py --top 20` ranks stale skills/agents as pruning candidates. Run quarterly; see [docs/deprecation-template.md](docs/deprecation-template.md).
