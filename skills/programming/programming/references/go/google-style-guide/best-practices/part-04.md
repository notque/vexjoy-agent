#### Custom verbosity levels

Use verbose logging ([`log.V`]) to your advantage. Verbose logging can be useful
for development and tracing. Establishing a convention around verbosity levels
can be helpful. For example:

*   Write a small amount of extra information at `V(1)`
*   Trace more information in `V(2)`
*   Dump large internal states in `V(3)`

To minimize the cost of verbose logging, you should ensure not to accidentally
call expensive functions even when `log.V` is turned off. `log.V` offers two
APIs. The more convenient one carries the risk of this accidental expense. When
in doubt, use the slightly more verbose style.

```go
// Good:
for _, sql := range queries {
  log.V(1).Infof("Handling %v", sql)
  if log.V(2) {
    log.Infof("Handling %v", sql.Explain())
  }
  sql.Run(...)
}
```

```go
// Bad:
// sql.Explain called even when this log is not printed.
log.V(2).Infof("Handling %v", sql.Explain())
```

### Program initialization

Program initialization errors (such as bad flags and configuration) should be
propagated upward to `main`, which should call `log.Exit` with an error that
explains how to fix the error. In these cases, `log.Fatal` should not generally
be used, because a stack trace that points at the check is not likely to be as
useful as a human-generated, actionable message.

<a id="checks-and-panics"></a>

### Program checks and panics

As stated in the [decision against panics], standard error handling should be
structured around error return values. Libraries should prefer returning an
error to the caller rather than aborting the program, especially for transient
errors.

It is occasionally necessary to perform consistency checks on an invariant and
terminate the program if it is violated. In general, this is only done when a
failure of the invariant check means that the internal state has become
unrecoverable. The most reliable way to do this in the Google codebase is to
call `log.Fatal`. Using `panic` in these cases is not reliable, because it is
possible for deferred functions to deadlock or further corrupt internal or
external state.

Similarly, resist the temptation to recover panics to avoid crashes, as doing so
can result in propagating a corrupted state. The further you are from the panic,
the less you know about the state of the program, which could be holding locks
or other resources. The program can then develop other unexpected failure modes
that can make the problem even more difficult to diagnose. Instead of trying to
handle unexpected panics in code, use monitoring tools to surface unexpected
failures and fix related bugs with a high priority.

**Note:** The standard [`net/http` server] violates this advice and recovers
panics from request handlers. Consensus among experienced Go engineers is that
this was a historical mistake. If you sample server logs from application
servers in other languages, it is common to find large stacktraces that are left
unhandled. Avoid this pitfall in your servers.

<a id="when-to-panic"></a>

### When to panic

The standard library panics on API misuse. For example, [`reflect`] issues a
panic in many cases where a value is accessed in a way that suggests it was
misinterpreted. This is analogous to the panics on core language bugs such as
accessing an element of a slice that is out of bounds. Code review and tests
should discover such bugs, which are not expected to appear in production code.
These panics act as invariant checks that do not depend on a library, as the
standard library does not have access to the [levelled `log`] package that the
Google codebase uses.

[`reflect`]: https://pkg.go.dev/reflect
[levelled `log`]: decisions#logging

Another case in which panics can be useful, though uncommon, is as an internal
implementation detail of a package which always has a matching recover in the
callchain. Parsers and similar deeply nested, tightly coupled internal function
groups can benefit from this design, where plumbing error returns adds
complexity without value.

The key attribute of this design is that these **panics are never allowed to
escape across package boundaries** and do not form part of the package's API.
This is typically accomplished with a top-level deferred function that uses
`recover` to translate a propagated panic into a returned error at the public
API boundary. It requires the code that panics and recovers to distinguish
between panics that the code raises itself and those that it doesn't:

```go
// Good:
type syntaxError struct {
  msg string
}

func parseInt(in string) int {
  n, err := strconv.Atoi(in)
  if err != nil {
    panic(&syntaxError{"not a valid integer"})
  }
}

func Parse(in string) (_ *Node, err error) {
  defer func() {
    if p := recover(); p != nil {
      sErr, ok := p.(*syntaxError)
      if !ok {
        panic(p) // Propagate the panic since it is outside our code's domain.
      }
      err = fmt.Errorf("syntax error: %v", sErr.msg)
    }
  }()
  ... // Parse input calling parseInt internally to parse integers
}
```

> resources associated with the code run in such defer-managed sections (e.g.,
> close, free, or unlock).
>
> See: [Go Tip #81: Avoiding Resource Leaks in API Design]

Panic is also used when the compiler cannot identify unreachable code, for
example when using a function like `log.Fatal` that will not return:

```go
// Good:
func answer(i int) string {
    switch i {
    case 42:
        return "yup"
    case 54:
        return "base 13, huh"
    default:
        log.Fatalf("Sorry, %d is not the answer.", i)
        panic("unreachable")
    }
}
```

[Do not call `log` functions before flags have been parsed.](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/golang/glog#pkg-overview)
If you must die in a package initialization function (an `init` or a
["must" function](decisions#must-functions)), a panic is acceptable in place of
the fatal logging call.

## Documentation

<a id="documentation-conventions"></a>

### Conventions

This section augments the decisions document's [commentary] section.

Go code that is documented in familiar style is easier to read and less likely
to be misused than something misdocumented or not documented at all. Runnable
[examples] show up in Godoc and Code Search and are an excellent way of
explaining how to use your code.

[examples]: decisions#examples

<a id="documentation-conventions-params"></a>

#### Parameters and configuration

Not every parameter must be enumerated in the documentation. This applies to:

*   function and method parameters
*   struct fields
*   APIs for options

Document the error-prone or non-obvious fields and parameters by saying why they
are interesting.

In the following snippet, the highlighted commentary adds little useful
information to the reader:

```go
// Bad:
// Sprintf formats according to a format specifier and returns the resulting
// string.
//
// format is the format, and data is the interpolation data.
func Sprintf(format string, data ...any) string
```

However, this snippet demonstrates a code scenario similar to the previous where
the commentary instead states something non-obvious or materially helpful to the
reader:

```go
// Good:
// Sprintf formats according to a format specifier and returns the resulting
// string.
//
// The provided data is used to interpolate the format string. If the data does
// not match the expected format verbs or the amount of data does not satisfy
// the format specification, the function will inline warnings about formatting
// errors into the output string as described by the Format errors section
// above.
func Sprintf(format string, data ...any) string
```

Consider your likely audience in choosing what to document and at what depth.
Maintainers, newcomers to the team, external users, and even yourself six months
in the future may appreciate slightly different information from what is on your
mind when you first come to write your docs.

<a id="documentation-conventions-contexts"></a>

#### Contexts

It is implied that the cancellation of a context argument interrupts the
function it is provided to. If the function can return an error, conventionally
it is `ctx.Err()`.

This fact does not need to be restated:

```go
// Bad:
// Run executes the worker's run loop.
//
// The method will process work until the context is cancelled and accordingly
// returns an error.
func (Worker) Run(ctx context.Context) error
```

Because that is implied, the following is better:

```go
// Good:
// Run executes the worker's run loop.
func (Worker) Run(ctx context.Context) error
```

Where context behavior is different or non-obvious, it should be expressly
documented if any of the following are true.

*   The function returns an error other than `ctx.Err()` when the context is
    cancelled:

    ```go
    // Good:
    // Run executes the worker's run loop.
    //
    // If the context is cancelled, Run returns a nil error.
    func (Worker) Run(ctx context.Context) error
    ```

*   The function has other mechanisms that may interrupt it or affect lifetime:

    ```go
    // Good:
    // Run executes the worker's run loop.
    //
    // Run processes work until the context is cancelled or Stop is called.
    // Context cancellation is handled asynchronously internally: run may return
    // before all work has stopped. The Stop method is synchronous and waits
    // until all operations from the run loop finish. Use Stop for graceful
    // shutdown.
    func (Worker) Run(ctx context.Context) error

    func (Worker) Stop()
    ```

*   The function has special expectations about context lifetime, lineage, or
    attached values:

    ```go
    // Good:
    // NewReceiver starts receiving messages sent to the specified queue.
    // The context should not have a deadline.
    func NewReceiver(ctx context.Context) *Receiver

    // Principal returns a human-readable name of the party who made the call.
    // The context must have a value attached to it from security.NewContext.
    func Principal(ctx context.Context) (name string, ok bool)
    ```

    **Warning:** Avoid designing APIs that make such demands (like contexts not
    having deadlines) from their callers. The above is only an example of how to
    document this if it cannot be avoided, not an endorsement of the pattern.

<a id="documentation-conventions-concurrency"></a>

#### Concurrency

Go users assume that conceptually read-only operations are safe for concurrent
use and do not require extra synchronization.

The extra remark about concurrency can safely be removed in this Godoc:

```go
// Len returns the number of bytes of the unread portion of the buffer;
// b.Len() == len(b.Bytes()).
//
// It is safe to be called concurrently by multiple goroutines.
func (*Buffer) Len() int
```

Mutating operations, however, are not assumed to be safe for concurrent use and
require the user to consider synchronization.

Similarly, the extra remark about concurrency can safely be removed here:

```go
// Grow grows the buffer's capacity.
//
// It is not safe to be called concurrently by multiple goroutines.
func (*Buffer) Grow(n int)
```

Documentation is strongly encouraged if any of the following are true.

*   It is unclear whether the operation is read-only or mutating:

    ```go
    // Good:
    package lrucache

    // Lookup returns the data associated with the key from the cache.
    //
    // This operation is not safe for concurrent use.
    func (*Cache) Lookup(key string) (data []byte, ok bool)
    ```

    Why? A cache hit when looking up the key mutate a LRU cache internally. How
    this is implemented may not be obvious to all readers.

*   Synchronization is provided by the API:

    ```go
    // Good:
    package fortune_go_proto

    // NewFortuneTellerClient returns an *rpc.Client for the FortuneTeller service.
    // It is safe for simultaneous use by multiple goroutines.
    func NewFortuneTellerClient(cc *rpc.ClientConn) *FortuneTellerClient
    ```

    Why? Stubby provides synchronization.

    **Note:** If the API is a type and the API provides synchronization in
    entirety, conventionally only the type definition documents the semantics.

*   The API consumes user-implemented types of interfaces, and the interface's
    consumer has particular concurrency requirements:

    ```go
    // Good:
    package health
