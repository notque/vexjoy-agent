"""Tests for scripts/validate-promoted-successors.py.

Contract under test: ``promoted_to`` retires a skill by removing it from
skills/INDEX.json, so both ways the tag can lie must fail.

P1 catches a successor that names nothing on disk — the husk is retired into
a void, which is how /do left the skill catalogue (promoted_to: native-router).
P2 catches a husk that still advertises ``user-invocable: true`` while the
index no longer carries it.

Run with: python3 -m pytest scripts/tests/test_validate_promoted_successors.py -v
