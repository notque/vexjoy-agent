"""Tests pinning trigger rendering in scripts/routing-manifest.py.

INDEX.json carries 1,791 hand-curated trigger phrases. They were loaded and
dropped one function later, leaving the router an alphabetical list of
descriptions with no discriminating signal. These tests pin what the full
manifest now emits, and the two rules that keep the emission safe and small.

Run with: python3 -m pytest scripts/tests/test_routing_manifest_triggers.py -v
