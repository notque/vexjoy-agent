"""Validate that every pipeline in pipeline-index.json points at a real doc.

``skills/process/workflow/references/pipeline-index.json`` is hand-maintained — the
generator that builds skills/INDEX.json and agents/INDEX.json skips it. Nothing
else checks it either: ``scripts/validate-do-references.py`` resolves component
*names* mentioned in prose, so an entry whose ``file`` points at a deleted doc
passes clean. That gap is not hypothetical. Commit b2db049e deleted
perses-dac-pipeline.md and perses-plugin-pipeline.md and claimed in its own
message to have cleaned this index; it never touched the file. Both entries
survived as routable pipelines backed by nothing, and every check in CI passed.

Three ways an entry goes wrong, one check each:

  P1 MISSING-FILE    ``file`` is absent, or names a path that does not exist.
                     The router can select the pipeline and the orchestrator
                     then has no phases to run.

  P2 PHANTOM-PHASE   A name in ``phases`` appears in no heading of the
                     referenced doc. The index advertises a phase the doc does
                     not define, so the manifest promises work that cannot run.
                     Live case: voice-writer declared 13 phases while its
                     ``file`` pointed at a seven-line pointer stub defining none.

  P3 NO-PHASES       ``phases`` is absent or empty. Phases are what makes a
                     pipeline a pipeline rather than a skill, and /do's
                     PIPELINE-SELECTION RULE keys on having real phases. Live
                     case: comprehensive-review and toolkit-improvement each
                     declared none while their docs defined 13 and 10.

Phase matching is deliberately loose — a declared phase counts as present when
it appears anywhere in any heading line, case-insensitively. Docs number and
decorate their headings ("## Phase 3c: WAVE 3 DISPATCH — Adversarial
Perspectives"), so anchoring tighter would fail on formatting rather than on
substance. The check catches a phase that is absent, not one that is styled
differently.

Exit codes:
    0 — every entry resolves to a doc that defines the phases it declares
    1 — one or more failures
