"""Deterministic safety-net + offline drift/benchmark tool for /do routing.

Pattern-matches user requests against trigger keywords from INDEX.json files.
In the /do flow this runs AFTER the semantic routing decision (the
orchestrator's in-session self-route), not before it: semantic intent routing
is primary, and this module is the deterministic safety-net. It enforces
safety-critical force-routes (a high-confidence force_route for pr-workflow or
a security skill overrides a disagreeing semantic pick so git/security work
always hits quality gates) and its phrase/unigram guards continue to suppress
false matches. It no longer short-circuits or skips the semantic route on the
long tail.

Offline, the same matching logic powers check-routing-drift.py and
routing-benchmark.py. The CLI, output shape, confidence levels, and guards are
a stable contract those tools depend on.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/pre-route.py --request "run go tests"
    python3 scripts/pre-route.py --request-file /tmp/req.txt --json-compact
    python3 scripts/pre-route.py --request "create a PR" --json-compact

Exit codes:
    0 -- always (output is JSON to stdout)
