"""Regression tests for the lint gate that catches undefined names (F821).

WHY THIS EXISTS

hooks/tests/test_adr_enforcement.py pins ONE undefined-name bug: the
``__EVENT_NAME`` / ``_EVENT_NAME`` typo that made adr-enforcement.py raise
NameError on every invocation and logged 1,795 crashes. That test pins the
specific typo and bans one specific shape (module-level ``__`` constants).

It does not pin the reason the typo survived. ``F821`` (undefined-name) — the
pyflakes rule that flags exactly this bug on sight — was listed in
pyproject.toml's global ``ignore`` as "false positives in conditional imports
and dynamic code". With the rule off, the repo's own lint gate reported "All
checks passed!" on the crashing file; with it on, that same file produces 8
F821 errors. The typo therefore shipped in the initial release and survived
until an unrelated refactor renamed the constant by accident.

The "false positives" claim was tested rather than assumed. Turning F821 on
across the whole repo produced TWO findings, and both were real latent
NameErrors, not false positives:

  * skills/meta/routing-table-updater/scripts/update_routing.py used
    ``re.match`` with no ``import re`` — NameError on every markdown table
    validated.
  * hooks/tests/test_do_routing.py registered
    ``test_routes_go_test_to_go_testing_skill``; the function is actually named
    ``..._to_go_patterns_skill`` — NameError that took the suite down.

Both are fixed. These tests keep the gate on and the repo clean, so the next
undefined name is caught by lint instead of by a hook crashing silently in its
own fail-open path.
