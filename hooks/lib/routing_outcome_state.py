"""Per-session bridge for next-turn routing-outcome resolution.

The PostToolUse:Agent hook (routing-decision-recorder.py) records the routing
decision row and appends a PROVISIONAL pending outcome (routing key + observed
error flag) here. Resolution happens at a SINGLE point per dispatch, when the
next-turn signal is available:

  - SubagentStop (routing-outcome-recorder.py): validates each pending entry's
    decision row exists; re-queues late rows (bounded) and revalidates healthy
    entries to stay pending. It NO LONGER applies boost/decay.
  - UserPromptSubmit (routing-outcome-finalizer.py): on the next user turn,
    finalizes still-pending entries from tool-errors + user reaction + re-route,
    applying boost/decay ONCE then clearing them (idempotent).
  - Stop (session-learning-recorder.py fallback): resolves any STILL-pending
    entries via the error flag alone (the deterministic floor) so autonomous /
    no-next-prompt runs still record an outcome.

State lives in a per-session JSON file under /tmp. All writes are atomic
(write-to-temp-then-rename) so an interrupted hook never corrupts the file.
Every function is best-effort and swallows errors — this bridge must never
block a hook.

Concurrency: parallel same-session ``PostToolUse:Agent`` dispatches (the NORMAL
case — /do Phase 4 and pr-review both fan out agents) issue concurrent
read-modify-write cycles against the same state file. Without serialization
those cycles lose updates (two readers see the same ``pending`` list, both
append one entry, the later writer's atomic rename clobbers the earlier one →
B drains fewer outcomes than A wrote → route-health under-counts). To prevent
this, every read-modify-write holds an EXCLUSIVE ``fcntl.flock`` on a sidecar
lock file across the WHOLE load→modify→write, so appends serialize and no
outcome is lost. The lock is advisory and best-effort: if locking is
unavailable the operation still proceeds (degraded, never blocking).

File shape:
    {
      "seen": ["<dispatch-sig>", ...],     # idempotency for the decision hook
      "pending": [{"key": "agent:skill", "errors": false,
                   "attempts": 0, "created": 1735000000.0}, ...]
    }

Idempotency (MEDIUM, TOCTOU): the decision hook claims a dispatch signature via
``claim_dispatch`` — an atomic check-and-set under the SAME flock as the write.
The previous split of ``dispatch_seen`` (unlocked read) + ``mark_dispatch_seen``
(locked write) let two concurrent duplicate deliveries both observe "unseen"
and double-record/double-score. ``claim_dispatch`` collapses both into one
locked critical section so exactly one caller wins.

Ordering (HIGH, A-before-B): action A (PostToolUse:Agent) writes the decision
row BEFORE appending the pending bridge entry, and PostToolUse:Agent fires
before SubagentStop — so the decision row is normally present when B drains.
If a B drains a pending key whose decision row is not yet visible (mistiming),
B RE-QUEUES that entry via ``requeue_pending_outcomes`` (bounded by
``MAX_REQUEUE_ATTEMPTS``) instead of discarding it, so a late-arriving decision
row gets scored on a subsequent stop. See adr/learn-step-to-hook.md.
