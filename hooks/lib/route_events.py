"""Append-only per-dispatch route event log (JSONL).

The aggregate routing rows in learning.db are keyed `(topic, key)` — they carry
no per-dispatch history, so faithful offline replay of "request → route →
outcome" is impossible from them alone. This module adds that history: one JSONL
line per event, append-only, at `<CLAUDE_LEARNING_DIR>/route-events.jsonl`.

Two producers:
  - routing-decision-recorder.py (PostToolUse:Agent) appends a DECISION event
    when it records a /do-routed dispatch.
  - routing-outcome-finalizer.py (UserPromptSubmit) appends an OUTCOME event
    when it finalizes a pending dispatch.

FAILURE-SAFE BY CONTRACT: a write error here must NEVER break the hook. Every
function swallows all exceptions and returns; the worst case is a lost event
line, never a non-zero hook exit. The log is auxiliary instrumentation, not the
source of truth (the aggregate rows remain authoritative).

Append-only: each event is one `json.dumps(...) + "\n"` opened in "a" mode, so
concurrent appends from parallel dispatches interleave at line granularity
(POSIX append writes under the per-line size are atomic) without a lock — no
read-modify-write, so there is no lost-update race to serialize.
