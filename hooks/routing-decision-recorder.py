PostToolUse Hook: Routing Decision Recorder (action A, formerly /do Phase 5)

Records the routing-decision row for every Agent dispatch so the routing
feedback loop (`learning-db.py route-health`) keeps receiving the rows it
needs. Replaces the hand-run `learning-db.py record routing ...` step that
lived in /do Phase 2 Step 4 + Phase 5 action A.

WORKFLOW DISPATCHES (v1.1.0): /do Complex dispatches run through the Workflow
tool. Its inner agent() calls fire NO PostToolUse:Agent event — the harness
emits ONE PostToolUse with tool_name "Workflow", carrying every worker prompt
(marker included) inside tool_input.script. So this hook also matches
"Workflow": it reads tool_input.script, finds ALL line-start [do-route]
markers (same anchored regex as the Agent path), and records one decision per
marker. Idempotency is keyed per marker LINE so a resubmitted script (workflow
resume) is a no-op. Pending outcomes are still appended per marker: Workflow
inner agents fire no SubagentStop, but resolution never needed one — the
UserPromptSubmit finalizer / Stop fallback resolve pendings on their normal
paths, and a SubagentStop from any other dispatch merely revalidates them
(their decision rows exist, written here first).

SCOPING — record ONLY /do-routed dispatches.
Every Agent dispatch fires PostToolUse:Agent, including pr-review's reviewer
sub-agents (code-reviewer, security-reviewer, reviewer-*) and any other
nested fan-out. Recording all of them would inflate route-health's denominator
with dispatches /do never routed. So /do stamps a machine-readable marker on
the prompts IT routes (Phase 4 Step 2):

    [do-route] agent={agent} skill={skill} complexity={complexity}

This hook records ONLY when that marker is present, and reads the agent + skill
directly FROM the marker (structured intent emitted by the router — not fragile
prompt-sniffing). No marker → not a /do routing decision → skip. This is the
sole scoping mechanism (no reviewer-name denylist).

PostToolUse:Agent fires AFTER the subagent completes, so the event carries
both the dispatch metadata (tool_input.subagent_type / .prompt / .description)
and the subagent's tool_result. From these we:
  1. Read the routing key {agent}:{skill} from the [do-route] marker
     (agent-only "{agent}:" when the marker carries no skill).
  2. Record topic="routing", category="effectiveness" with observable fields
     (tool_errors, request/description snippet).
  3. (C) Parse a `rightsizing:tier{N}` banner from the subagent output and
     record a separate rightsizing row, parse-only and silent when absent.
  4. (D, v1.3.0) Parse the `route-fit:` banner from the subagent output and
     score it ASYMMETRICALLY: a negative verdict decays the route, `ok` is a
     no-op that boosts nothing. Parse-only and silent when absent. See
     record_route_fit for why a self-report may only move against the router.
  5. Write a pending-outcome entry to a per-session file so the SubagentStop
     hook (routing-outcome-recorder.py) can recover the full key + the error
     verdict and apply boost/decay. PostToolUse:Agent fires before
     SubagentStop, so the decision row is committed before the outcome runs —
     the ordering dependency is honored structurally.

Idempotency: a per-session state file keyed by a dispatch signature stops the
same dispatch being recorded twice (e.g. on retries). The DB upsert on
(topic, key) is also idempotent.

Design Principles:
- SILENT (records to DB, no context injection)
- Non-blocking (always exits 0)
- Fast execution (<50ms target); lazy imports
