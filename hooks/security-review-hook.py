Local Security Review Hook (ADR: adr/local-security-review.md)

Single-file hook that dispatches on the `hook_event_name` field of the JSON it
reads from stdin. Two paths, no Agent SDK, no API key, no network calls:

| Event       | Condition                       | Behavior                                            |
|-------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| PreToolUse  | Bash command contains git commit| Scan STAGED files via scripts/security-review-scan. |
|             |                                 | HIGH/CRITICAL -> JSON permissionDecision:deny.      |
| PostToolUse | Edit / Write / MultiEdit        | Scan the just-edited file via the same scanner rules|
|             |                                 | and inject findings as ADVISORY additionalContext.  |
|             |                                 | Never blocks (PostToolUse runs after the edit) —    |
|             |                                 | matches Anthropic's edit-time firing.               |
| Stop        | (always)                        | asyncRewake the session agent with the working-tree |
|             |                                 | diff + instruction to run the security-review skill.|

The commit gate (PreToolUse) is the ONLY blocking path. PostToolUse and Stop are
advisory — they inform but never deny, mirroring the ADR's "Stop is advisory" rule
and Anthropic's edit-time PostToolUse reminders.

The deterministic regex layer is `scripts/security-review-scan.py` (the single
source of detection rules — called as a subprocess with `--staged --format json`).
The LLM-depth layer is the CURRENT Claude session: the Stop hook injects the diff
as rewake context and the session agent performs the parallel-code-review Security
pass itself. There is no separate model call.

Contracts:
- PreToolUse deny mirrors `hooks/pretool-branch-safety.py` /
  `hooks/pretool-config-protection.py`: stdout JSON
  `{"hookSpecificOutput": {"hookEventName": "PreToolUse",
  "permissionDecision": "deny", "permissionDecisionReason": ...}}`, exit 0.
- Stop asyncRewake mirrors the official security-guidance plugin's
  security_reminder_hook.py: the rewake context is written to stderr, the hook
  exits 2 (the asyncRewake signal), and a stdout JSON line carries a per-run
  `rewakeSummary`. The `asyncRewake`/`rewakeMessage`/`rewakeSummary` config keys
  live in .claude/settings.json. Stop is ADVISORY — it never blocks a commit.

Bypass / kill switches:
- VEXJOY_SECURITY_REVIEW_SKIP=1     disables the commit BLOCK (deliberate override).
- VEXJOY_SECURITY_REVIEW_DISABLE=1  disables the hook entirely (both events).
- VEXJOY_SECURITY_REVIEW_DEDUP_TTL_SECONDS=N  Opt-in TTL for Stop dedup. Unset or
                                              0 = no TTL (permanent until the diff
                                              changes). Positive int = old TTL
                                              behavior with that window in seconds.

Stop dedup: byte-identical working-tree diffs (under the same cwd) short-circuit
instead of triggering another rewake. By default, dedup is permanent — same diff
means same diff. The state file self-heals: a non-matching hash overwrites the old
one, so a stale record is a no-op. State persists to
~/.claude/state/security-review-hook/last-diff-hash.json via atomic write.

Fail-open: any internal error allows the commit / skips the rewake and prints a
warning to stderr. A crashed hook never blocks a tool and never stalls a session.
